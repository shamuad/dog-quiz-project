My git workflow
In this project I try to use:

Good commit messages
Well named branches
Pull requests with summaries
If you have feedback to improve my git usage: please drop me a line!

Here is my branching model for this project.

master (auto deploys) ______________________
                       \               /
development             \_____________/- pull request
                         \           /
feature/some-feature      \_commits_/- pull request
My agile workflow and Trello board
I try to maintain a backlog eventhough I'm working on a project by myself. That way people can quickly jump in and start helping out. It also displays how I split up my tasks and try to build this project in an iterative and incremental way!
